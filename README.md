# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-with-AI
An advanced, AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python and Tkinter, featuring a modern, responsive graphical interface and intelligent gameplay mechanics. The project supports both Player vs Player and Player vs AI modes, with dynamic board sizes (3x3, 4x4, 5x5) and multiple AI difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

# 🧠 Smart Tic-Tac-Toe Game 
AI-Powered Python Application with Dynamic GUI (Tkinter)

🔹 Project Summary A modern, interactive, and AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and Tkinter. It features intelligent gameplay through the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, responsive GUI, scalable board sizes, and both single-player and two-player modes.

🔹 Project Description This project brings the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game to life with an elegant GUI and advanced AI strategies. It supports Player vs Player as well as Player vs AI gameplay, allowing users to choose from different board sizes (3x3, 4x4, 5x5) and multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

The artificial intelligence opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves. The GUI is built with Tkinter, styled with a custom dark theme and intuitive interactions, including hover effects, animated button clicks, and visually highlighted winning lines.

Additional user-friendly features such as undo functionality, dynamic resizing, and move tracking enhance the gameplay experience. The project emphasizes clean coding practices using object-oriented programming, modular design, and performance optimization techniques.
